Here is the credentials i have. Credentials: \n{cls._input}. Now after every input field found i will give you a prompt. The prompt will look like "Enter your email" / "Enter Password" / "Username" etc also there can be an optional event_str look like "SetTextEvent(state=471db0b34dd4b9be2ac8f0917d8e947a, view=23945eb0f968dd6ba05de8382ade54e1(Login)/EditText-Enter your), text=)". From the event_str you can get knowledge about what page are you in now so use credential accordingly. Your work is to find for this prompt what existing credential i should use. My credentials are in key value format. You have to give me the key name only with proper case maintained. If you found something that that is not your prompt type like if you encounter a prompt example@gmail.com then you have to be smart and send response as email because this value belong to an email.Also if you found **** then it must be a password so respond pass. So finally just dont look for the key name if you found something that matches any value in the existing credential then also repond the corresponding key name.\nExample:\nCredentials:\nemail: saimon@gmail.com\npass: 12345678\nprompt: Enter your email\nresponse: email\nprompt: Enter Password\nresponse: pass\nprompt: Bhuiyan\nresponse: l_name.\nAlso use credentials that are actual_... only for Login page any type of login page for first time, otherwise use random credentials. Like if i ask for email then one time give me email5 then next time give me email7. Use randomize value.'

Finally return me a json where my given credentials key should be named "actual_email": "example@gmail.com", "actual_pass": "12345678" etc. And the 10 variation should be like "email1": "something@gmail.com" and so on and all the key and value should properly double quoted.'
